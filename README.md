Project Overview (README.md):

Write a detailed description of the ATM system, its features, and intended use cases. Explain how it simulates ATM operations like balance checking, withdrawals, deposits, and account management. Include visuals or diagrams if applicable.
Installation Instructions:

Provide clear setup instructions for running the ATM system locally. List any prerequisites (programming language, libraries, etc.) and include installation commands. This could be in the README or a separate INSTALL.md file.
Feature Breakdown:

Create a section that outlines the key features of your ATM system. Discuss functionalities like user authentication, transaction history, and error handling. You might also include information about any security measures implemented.
Code Documentation:

Ensure that your code is well-commented to explain the logic behind different functions and classes. Consider adding a docs/ folder that provides in-depth documentation of the architecture, including how various components interact within the system.
Contributing Guidelines:

Set up a CONTRIBUTING.md file to encourage collaboration. Outline how others can contribute to the project, including coding standards, reporting issues, and submitting pull requests. This helps foster an open development environment.
